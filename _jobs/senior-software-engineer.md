## About the company and the role

At Lendurai, we enable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to operate independently of global navigation satellite systems and radio control, using computer vision and machine learning. We partner with multiple UAV manufacturers to deliver cost effective capabilities to public sector and defence customers. Our core team has substantial experience in aerospace engineering and developing computer vision applications across Europe, including at companies like Bolt (EE), Open Cosmos (UK), and Starship Technologies (EE).

## What you will be doing

* Integrate third-party solutions with our platform.  
* Develop lab prototypes for visual navigation systems for UAV autonomy.  
* Bring prototypes to life on Single-Board Computers (SBCs) like Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, or Jetson, ensuring compatibility and optimising performance with various drone platforms.  
* Learn to fly multi-rotor drones in simulators and conduct field tests with physical drones to validate your work.

## We are looking for 

Required skills:

* Proficiency in C++11 or later and C99.  
* Proficiency in Linux environments.  
* Hands-on experience with SBCs such as Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, or similar.

Nice to have:

* Previous experience with embedded systems, especially STM32 microcontrollers.

## Additional skills that are advantageous

* Computer Vision – knowledge of techniques like object detection, feature tracking, and homography.  
* Mathematics – understanding of linear algebra, calculus.  
* Analysis/Control – familiarity with PID, Fourier, Laplace, Z-transform, "poles and zeros".  
* Statistics/Probability – experience with Kalman filter, aware of Bayesian theorem.  
* Digital Electronics – understanding of logic gates, UART, I2C, SPI, CAN.

## What we offer

* Monthly gross salary €4,500-7,000  
* Stock options  
* Ability to influence major technical decisions as an early hire  
* A focus on outcomes
