## About the company and the role

At **Lendurai**, we enable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to operate independently of global navigation satellite systems and radio control, using computer vision and machine learning. We partner with multiple UAV manufacturers to deliver cost-effective capabilities to public sector and defence customers. Our team has deep experience in aerospace engineering, defence tech, and autonomous systems, with backgrounds at companies like Bolt (EE), Open Cosmos (UK), and Starship Technologies (EE).

We're looking for a **Head of Business Development** to lead our commercial efforts. You'll drive B2G (business-to-government) sales, build partnerships with UAV manufacturers, expand into new defense markets, and shape our go-to-market strategy alongside the CEO. As we grow, you'll also be responsible for building and leading the business development team.

## What you will be doing

- Own and drive B2G and defence sector sales end-to-end, including relationship building, tendering, and negotiations
- Identify, reach out to, and close strategic partnerships with UAV manufacturers and integrators
- Lead market expansion across Europe, NATO-aligned countries, and beyond
- Represent the company at defence expos, investor meetings, and customer demos
- Work with the CEO and engineering leadership to refine the product roadmap based on customer feedback
- Build out the business development function and team as the company grows

## We are looking for

**Required experience:**
- 5+ years in business development, sales, or partnerships in a defence, aerospace, or deep tech company
- Proven track record in B2G sales and/or working with defence primes or UAV producers
- Experience navigating complex procurement cycles, ideally within government or defence
- A self-starter mindset with a strong bias for action and results
- Excellent written and verbal communication skills (English required; other languages are a plus)

**Nice to have:**
- Prior experience in a startup or scaleup environment where adaptability was key to success
- Existing network in defence ministries, procurement offices, or the UAV ecosystem
- Familiarity with NATO, EU or Ukraine defence programs and funding mechanisms

**Backgrounds that may be well-aligned:**
This is a mission-critical role. It's especially well-suited for individuals with a strong understanding of how defense systems are acquired and deployedâ€”whether from government, industry, or operational military roles.

If you've worked in defense operations, procurement, intelligence, or UAV deployment, you'll find a strong fit here. Your work will directly influence operational capabilities in real-world defence scenarios and shape our expansion into key NATO-aligned markets.

## What we offer

- Competitive cash salary and equity options
- A mission-driven team that values ownership, curiosity, and a hands-on approach to solving defense challenges
- The opportunity to own and scale a core function in a rapidly growing defence tech startup
- Access to strategic government, military, and aerospace networks
- Work that directly supports national and allied defence
