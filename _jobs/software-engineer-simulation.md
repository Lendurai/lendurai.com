## About the company and the role

At **Lendurai**, we enable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to operate independently of global navigation satellite systems and radio control, using computer vision and machine learning. We partner with multiple UAV manufacturers to deliver cost-effective capabilities to public sector and defence customers. Our team has deep experience in aerospace engineering, defence tech, and autonomous systems, with backgrounds at companies like Bolt (EE), Open Cosmos (UK), and Starship Technologies (EE).

As a Software Engineer with a focus on simulation development, you will play a critical role in improving our product development environment and making it more transferable to real-world UAV operations.

## What you will be doing

- Design, develop, and optimize a simulation environment that reflects real-world UAV operations, including flight dynamics, sensor fusion, and mission scenarios
- Work closely with flight-control engineers to ensure that the simulator mimics real-world systems behavior, including attitude control, sensor fusion, and navigation.
- Implement software for user training simulators to provide realistic flight training experiences for end-users operating our drones in different environments.
- Focus on making the simulator environment scalable and customizable for various user needs and operational conditions.
- Integrate real-time flight data and mission parameters into the simulator for accurate feedback and analysis.
- Collaborate with cross-functional teams to iterate and enhance the training environment and product simulator based on feedback and ongoing R&D efforts.

## We are looking for

**Required skills:**
- Proficiency in C++14 and C99 (or newer).
- Proficiency in Linux environments.
- Experience with real-time graphics and simulation, preferably in the context of unmanned systems or robotics.
- Knowledge of 3D modeling, graphics rendering, and real-time simulation frameworks.

**Nice to have:**
- Familiarity with flight control systems (PX4, ArduPilot, or similar).
- Experience with training simulation design, including immersive user experiences, feedback loops, and interactivity.
- Understanding of sensor fusion and integration of real-world data into the simulation environment.

**Additional skills that are advantageous:**
- Multi-threading, concurrency, and real-time systems — Proficiency in designing and optimizing real-time, high-performance simulation environments.
- Classical mechanics — Understanding rigid body dynamics and kinematics to model realistic UAV motion in simulations.
- Aerodynamics — Knowledge of airfoil properties, lift, drag, thrust generation, and rotor dynamics, particularly as applied to both fixed-wing UAVs and multirotors in flight dynamics.

**Preferred backgrounds:**
- Game Development or Simulation Engineering — Experience in creating realistic simulations in environments like Unreal Engine, focusing on physics and user interactivity.

## What we offer

- Monthly gross salary €4,500-7,000 based on experience and impact
- Stock options
- Ability to influence major technical decisions as an early hire
- A focus on outcomes
