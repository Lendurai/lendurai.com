## About the company and the role

At **Lendurai**, we enable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to operate independently of global navigation satellite systems and radio control, using computer vision and machine learning. We partner with multiple UAV manufacturers to deliver cost effective capabilities to public sector and defence customers. Our core team has substantial experience in aerospace engineering and developing computer vision applications across Europe, including at companies like Bolt (EE), Open Cosmos (UK), and Starship Technologies (EE).

As a **UAV Field Operations Engineer** you will own the day-to-day flight-test loop in Tallinn: plan, fly, measure, iterate, and showcase our tech to end-users in defence, public sector and OEM partners.

## What you will be doing

* Execute manual and automated test flights.  
* Flash experimental firmware and software builds; maintain fleet configuration control.  
* Diagnose and fix basic mechanical and electrical problems on the field.  
* Maintain testing units for development and demo events.  
* Capture, parse and visualise telemetry/video; feed insights to product and software engineering teams.  
* Tuning PID controllers and other flight controller parameters to optimise the platform for responsiveness and performance.  
* Drive a safety-first culture: pre-flight risk reviews, on-site range safety, incident logs.  
* Improve test velocity, tooling and process through continuous experimentation.  
* Liaise with Estonian CAA/EASA to keep every campaign inside “Specific” category approvals (SORA, LUC or ad-hoc operational authorisations).  
* Train end users to use Lendurai products effectively.  
* Plan and fly demo days for defence customers; provide light account-management follow-up.

## We are looking for

Required:

* Experience flying multirotor UAVs in manual modes (Acro); BVLOS or “Specific” category remote-pilot certificate (or readiness to obtain within 2 months).  
* Using ground-stations (PX4/QGC, MAVLink) and log analysers (Flight Review, Mission Planner, Python tooling).  
* Comfort with flashing firmware, wiring ESCs/flight-controllers, and troubleshooting RF/telemetry links.  
* Fluent English and Estonian; EU/NATO passport or clearance-eligible  
* Category B driving licence.

Nice to have:

* Experience tuning PID controllers.  
* Python/notebook skills for quick telemetry analytics.  
* Working knowledge of EASA Reg. 2019/947 & 2019/945; able to draft SORA Annex B checklists.  
* Prior demo-pilot experience with defence or public-safety agencies.  
* Military service history.

## What we offer

* Monthly gross salary €2,200-3,200  
* Ability to influence major technical decisions as an early hire  
* A focus on outcomes  
* Freedom of working in nature
