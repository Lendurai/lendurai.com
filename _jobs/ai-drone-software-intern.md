## About the company and the role

At **Lendurai**, we enable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to operate independently of global navigation satellite systems and radio control, using computer vision and machine learning. We partner with multiple UAV manufacturers to deliver cost-effective capabilities to public sector and defence customers. Our team has deep experience in aerospace engineering, defence tech, and autonomous systems, with backgrounds at companies like Bolt (EE), Open Cosmos (UK), and Starship Technologies (EE).

We are offering a 3–4 months paid internship (flexible start in Q3 2025). As a software development intern you will work with our senior software engineers on features all over the full drone software stack — system, perception, control, planning, simulation.

## You’ll work on

* Software platform features related to telemetry and video streaming   
* Prototype and test computer vision & flight control algorithms (C++)  
* Extend our simulation stack with new aircraft and terrain models  
* Analyse flight-test logs, design experiments, tune ML pipelines

## We are looking for

**Core skills:** 

* Good programming skills in C/C++ and Python  
* Understanding of real-time systems and low-level programming  
* Experience with applied machine learning

**Nice to have:**

* BSc/MSc/PhD in Machine Learning, Robotics, Computer Vision, Aerospace, or related PX4/Ardupilot, Pytorch, OpenCV  
* Prior UAV-related projects.

## What We Offer

* **Paid internship** – monthly stipend for the full 3-4 month program  
* **Learn to fly drones** – join the team at the airfields for hands-on tests where you’ll deploy your code, run pre-flight checklists, pilot the drones, and oversee autonomous flights  
* **Career runway** – top-performing interns receive a fast-track full-time offer

To apply, please provide your CV, cover letter, links to your publications, projects and code.
