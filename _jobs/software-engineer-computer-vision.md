## About the company and the role

At **Lendurai**, we enable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to operate independently of global navigation satellite systems and radio control, using computer vision and machine learning. We partner with multiple UAV manufacturers to deliver cost-effective capabilities to public sector and defence customers. Our team has deep experience in aerospace engineering, defence tech, and autonomous systems, with backgrounds at companies like Bolt (EE), Open Cosmos (UK), and Starship Technologies (EE).

As a **Computer Vision Engineer** you’ll work on building up the AI stack that lets our aircraft understand the world in GNSS-denied airspace, based purely on visual perception. We're looking for someone who enjoys figuring things out when the path isn’t clear. Someone who likes exploring wild ideas, but also cares about making them actually work in the real world. You should feel comfortable with creative freedom, enjoy high levels of autonomy, be okay with uncertainty and shifting goals. 

## What you will be doing

* **Designing, implementing & improving core CV modules:** visual odometry, SLAM, obstacle detection, terrain recognition, scene recognition, etc.  
* **Designing and training neural networks for real-time inference** on embedded GPUs/NPUs, as well as specialized SOMs and NN accelerators  
* **Collaborating across the full drone software stack** — perception, control, planning, simulation  
* **Learning to fly drones.** Hands-on testing is the part of the job, you will be joining the team at the airfields where you will:  
  - deploy your code and make sure it’s properly integrated  
  - run pre-flight checklists  
  - pilot the drones, and oversee autonomous flights.

## We are looking for 

**Required skills:**

* Strong C/C++ and Python programming skills (for both rapid prototyping & production code)  
* Theoretical and applied knowledge of computer vision algorithms  
* Strong grounding in deep learning architectures and applications  
* Track record of designing complex systems that operate outside the lab

**Additional skills that are nice to have:**

* Experience with Pytorch, OpenCV  
* UAV or robotics background (work experience or education)  
* Experience with deploying neural networks on resource-constrained, real-time systems (mobile / embedded / robotics)  
* Experience with camera calibration  
* Experience with probabilistic estimation: Kalman/particle filters, bayesian inference

## What we offer

* Monthly gross salary €4,500-7,000 based on experience and impact  
* Stock options  
* Ability to influence major technical decisions as an early hire  
* A focus on outcomes
