            <h2>About the company and the role</h2>
            <p>At <strong>Lendurai</strong>, we enable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to operate independently of global navigation satellite systems and radio control, using computer vision and machine learning. We partner with multiple UAV manufacturers to deliver cost-effective capabilities to public sector and defence customers. Our team has deep experience in aerospace engineering, defence tech, and autonomous systems, with backgrounds at companies like Bolt (EE), Open Cosmos (UK), and Starship Technologies (EE).</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">We're looking for a <strong>Head of Strategic Affairs</strong> to lead our communications, public positioning, and government-facing initiatives. This role combines branding and narrative development, oversight of strategic R&D programmes and grants (e.g. <strong>EDF</strong>, <strong>NATO DIANA</strong>, <strong>EIC</strong>, Horizon Europe), and direct engagement with government stakeholders. You'll shape how we present ourselves to decision-makers, position Lendurai within the right strategic and funding networks, and build long-term influence across the European and NATO defence landscape.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">This is a senior, cross-functional leadership role suited for someone who understands both narrative power and policy mechanics—and can operate credibly with governments, press, and partners.</p>

            <h2>What you will be doing</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Own company-wide marketing, communications, and branding strategy</li>
                <li>Lead application and execution of European and national defence R&D programmes (EDF, NATO DIANA, EIC, etc.)</li>
                <li>Manage relationships with grant agencies, consortium partners, and evaluators</li>
                <li>Develop and execute our lobbying and influence strategy with government stakeholders</li>
                <li>Craft messaging for investors, public-sector partners, and media</li>
                <li>Work with the CEO to position the company in the broader strategic and defence tech landscape</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>We are looking for</h2>
            <p>Required experience:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>5+ years in strategic communications, public affairs, defence policy, or grant programme management</li>
                <li>Proven track record with EU or national R&D programmes (e.g. EDF, Horizon Europe, EIC, NATO DIANA)</li>
                <li>Strong writing and narrative development skills</li>
                <li>Experience working with or influencing public-sector decision-makers</li>
                <li>Fluency in English (additional European languages are a plus)</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Preferred backgrounds:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Government affairs or public policy leads from aerospace or defence companies</li>
                <li>R&D or grant programme managers from EU institutions or national innovation agencies</li>
                <li>Strategic communications professionals from defence ministries, think tanks, or STRATCOM</li>
                <li>Senior military officers or MoD liaisons with procurement or policy experience</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What we offer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Competitive cash salary and equity options</li>
                <li>A mission-driven team that values ownership, curiosity, and a hands-on approach to solving defence challenges</li>
                <li>Strategic ownership of Lendurai's positioning in European and NATO ecosystems</li>
                <li>Direct influence on our participation in flagship defence programmes</li>
                <li>Tight collaboration with a focused, technical, and mission-driven team</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">Join Lendurai to be part of the forefront of defence technology innovation.</p>
