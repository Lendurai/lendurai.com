            <h2>About the company and the role</h2>
            <p>At <strong>Lendurai</strong>, we enable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to operate independently of global navigation satellite systems and radio control, using computer vision and machine learning. We partner with multiple UAV manufacturers to deliver cost-effective capabilities to public sector and defence customers. Our team has deep experience in aerospace engineering, defence tech, and autonomous systems, with backgrounds at companies like Bolt (EE), Open Cosmos (UK), and Starship Technologies (EE).</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">As a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> with a focus on <strong>simulation development</strong>, you will play a critical role in improving our product development environment and making it more transferable to real-world UAV operations.</p>

            <h2>What you will be doing</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Design, develop, and optimize a simulation environment that reflects real-world UAV operations, including flight dynamics, sensor fusion, and mission scenarios</li>
                <li>Work closely with flight-control engineers to ensure that the simulator mimics real-world systems behavior, including attitude control, sensor fusion, and navigation</li>
                <li>Implement software for user training simulators to provide realistic flight training experiences for end-users operating our drones in different environments</li>
                <li>Focus on making the simulator environment scalable and customizable for various user needs and operational conditions</li>
                <li>Integrate real-time flight data and mission parameters into the simulator for accurate feedback and analysis</li>
                <li>Collaborate with cross-functional teams to iterate and enhance the training environment and product simulator based on feedback and ongoing R&D efforts</li>
            </ul>
