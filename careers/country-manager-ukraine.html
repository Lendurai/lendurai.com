                <li>Proven ability to navigate high-trust stakeholder environments and close deals</li>
                <li>Strong execution skills and ability to work independently</li>
                <li>Excellent communication, writing, and negotiation skills in <strong>Ukrainian</strong> and <strong>English</strong></li>
